          At Lux Health, we believe care <u>providers with greater <strong>choice</strong>, <strong>autonomy</strong>, and ability to heal based on their <strong>individual values</strong></u> are more resilient to burnout, serving more patients in their lifetime.
          <br /><br />
          So, we provide <u>everything concierge clinics need to see patients the way they want and get paid without the administrative work</u> - all for percent-on-collections.  <u>No monthly fee, individual licenses, or lock-in</u>.

      <h3>How We Help Providers</h3>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help you provide accessible personalized healthcare for all.  In this pursuit, we help lower your costs and any tasks that are not patient care.  We believe there is nothing that cannot be delegated (law and oath permitting).  Our Lux Concierge team is available at the press of a button, phone call, secure message, or email.  If we fail to improve the performance of your practice, you can terminate our services at any time.

      <h3>Back Office</h3>
      <p>We help manage revenue cycles, recurring membership dues, monthly billing, and more.  Whether it means manually following-up with patients or calling up payers, we will handle that automatically or at the press of a button.  Need help tracking your outcomes data?  We will do the administrative work and data analysis, so you can provide excellent care.</p>

      <h3>Reach More Patients</h3>
      <p>We help patients get to know you and your personal care model.  Serve new patients and improve navigation using traditional, digital, and social media channels with our Lux Concierge Team.  We help collect, gather, and address anonymized reviews and ratings.  Then we help manage your reputation in the community by telling your story.  You are much more than the lone Google or Yelp review. We will help share your values and offerings.</p>

      <h3>We Are Your Team</h3>
      <p>
      Our Lux Health team is an extension of your team.  We are available for any task at the press of a button, phone call, secure message, or email.  Our Lux Concierge team is availble to your patients when you and your team are on or off.  Any questions about billing, payments, triage, encounters, and more can be handled by us first, allowing your team to solely focus on treating more patients.

      <h3>Zero Upfront: <br />You always get paid first, <br />then we get paid.</h3>
      <p>
        No lock-in, monthly fees, or per user charges.  If you want to take a vacation, you should be able to without being charged.
        <br /><br />
        Whether you want to continue with your billing system or leverage Lux Health's automated, full-service billing and clearinghouse, we only take a percentage on <u>successful</u> reimbursement, collection, or payments.
        <br /><br />
        This positively aligns our goals.  We are committed to assist you in any way to make your practice a success.

      <h3>Business Support</h3>
      <p>We share your goal of practicing high-quality care, while ensuring successful reimbursement.  Balancing patient care and reimbursement can be a difficult, especially with the cost of labor, operations, and clinic space on the rise.  It hurts everyone when an effective clinic or hospital is forced to close.
